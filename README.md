Spark Core
====

The hardware design for the Spark Core.

## TODO
- Re-do the stencil but mirrored correctly
- Make sure part numbers match BOM
- Clean up schematic
- Clean up assembly diagram

## NECESSARY TESTING
- Get CC3000 and STM32 talking
- Get memory module and STM32 talking
- Test all of the pins, LEDs, buttons, etc.
- Make the VDDA circuit actually work and not kill the board

## NEXT REVISION
- Replace memory module with a smaller footprint one
